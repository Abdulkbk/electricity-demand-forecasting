# Project Proposal: Short-Term Electrical Load Forecasting using AI

**Author:** Abdullahi Yunus (U18EE1106)

This repository hosts an interactive Single Page Application (SPA) presenting a project proposal titled "Short-Term Electrical Load Demand Forecasting using Artificial Intelligence Techniques." The proposal outlines a plan to develop and evaluate AI-based models for accurate short-term electrical load forecasting.

## About This Repository

The primary content of this repository is the `index.html` file, which serves as an interactive web page to present the project proposal in a structured and engaging manner.

## Key Features of the Interactive Proposal

- **Single Page Application:** All proposal content is accessible on a single page for a smooth user experience.
- **Interactive Navigation:** A sticky navigation bar with smooth scrolling allows users to easily jump to different sections of the proposal.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS, the page is designed to be responsive and viewable across various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobiles).
- **Mobile-Friendly Menu:** A hamburger menu is available for easy navigation on smaller screens.
- **Clear Content Presentation:** Each section of the proposal is presented in distinct cards and blocks for readability.
- **Visual Timeline:** A CSS-based visual timeline presents the project schedule.
- **Contextual Callouts:** Important information, such as the "Nigerian Context" for the problem statement and dataset, is highlighted.

## Proposal Structure

The project proposal is organized into the following main sections:

1.  **Project Overview:** Introduction to load forecasting and the problem statement, including the Nigerian context.
2.  **Aim & Objectives:** The primary goal and specific objectives of the project.
3.  **Approach & Scope:** Details on the forecasting horizon, dataset, data sources, AI techniques to be explored, evaluation metrics, and methodology.
4.  **Impact & Outcomes:** Expected deliverables and the significance of the project.
5.  **Timeline & Resources:** A tentative project timeline and required software, hardware, and academic resources.
6.  **References:** A placeholder for academic citations.

## Technologies Used

1.  Clone this repository or download the files.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

## Project Focus (STLF using AI)

The core of the proposal itself focuses on:

- Addressing the challenges of traditional Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) methods.
- Leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) techniques (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) to improve forecasting accuracy.
- Utilizing historical load data, weather data, and calendar features for model training.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAPE, and MAE.

This interactive proposal aims to provide a clear, detailed, and accessible overview of the planned research and development.
